# react-cssmodules-demo
This project illustrates using CSS Modules in React applications created by the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) tool (CRA).

The code is based on two articles:
* [Practical Guide to React and CSS Modules](https://www.triplet.fi/blog/practical-guide-to-react-and-css-modules/);
* [How to Use CSS Modules with Create React App](https://medium.com/nulogy/how-to-use-css-modules-with-create-react-app-9e44bec2b5c2).

Another possibility to use CSS Modules without ejecting from CRA is described in article ["How to Use CSS Modules with Create React App"](https://medium.com/nulogy/how-to-use-css-modules-with-create-react-app-9e44bec2b5c2).
